# Personal Website

This website contains information about me, such as my skills, projects and recent activity on Github.

## Technologies

This is a ReactJS SPA, written in TypeScript. It uses Webpack for bundling and NPM for package management. For deployment, I'm currently using Vercel.

## Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

 * NodeJS v22 or higher

### Startup Steps

To run the site:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the modules
3. Run `npm start` to start the project.

The site will run locally through Webpack's dev server.

### Building
